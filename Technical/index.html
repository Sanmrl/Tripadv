            <h5>Love Travel</h5>
            <div class="pra">
              <p>
                Loving traveling is important to work in TripAdvisor because the
                company is dedicated to providing the best travel experiences
                and advice to its customers. To achieve this goal, employees
                need to have a deep passion for travel and a firsthand
                understanding of different destinations and cultures. This
                allows them to offer personalized recommendations and insights
                that resonate with customers and help them make informed
                decisions about their travel plans. Furthermore, employees who
                love traveling are more likely to be motivated and engaged in
                their work, as they are passionate about what they do. They are
                also better equipped to identify emerging travel trends and
                customer preferences, which can help the company stay ahead of
                the curve in the dynamic travel industry. In summary, loving
                traveling is essential for working at TripAdvisor, as it enables
                employees to provide exceptional customer service, stay engaged
                in their work, and contribute to the company's success.

            <h5>Transparency</h5>
            <div class="pra">
              <p>
                Being transparent is important because it fosters trust and
                credibility, both in personal and professional relationships.
                When individuals are transparent, they share information openly
                and honestly, which helps to build strong and authentic
                relationships based on mutual understanding and respect. This
                can lead to better communication, collaboration, and
                problem-solving. Additionally, transparency can improve
                accountability and integrity, as it encourages individuals to
                take responsibility for their actions and decisions. This can
                lead to greater trust from colleagues, customers, and
                stakeholders, which can in turn lead to greater opportunities
                for success and growth. In summary, transparency is essential
                for building trust, promoting accountability, and fostering
                strong and meaningful relationships.

            <h5>Better Togheter</h5>
            <div class="pra">
              <p>
                It's better to be together because collaboration and teamwork
                can lead to better outcomes than working alone. When individuals
                work together, they can combine their strengths and skills to
                achieve common goals, solve complex problems, and make better
                decisions. Collaboration also promotes creativity and
                innovation, as individuals can bounce ideas off one another,
                leading to new and improved solutions. Additionally, working
                together can create a sense of shared purpose and community,
                which can lead to greater motivation, job satisfaction, and
                overall well-being. In summary, working together can lead to
                better outcomes, greater innovation, and a more positive work
                environment.

            <h5>Act like an owner</h5>
            <div class="pra">
              <p>
                Acting like a leader, even from a non-leading position, is
                crucial for personal and professional development. First and
                foremost, it helps to establish credibility and earn the respect
                of colleagues and superiors, which can lead to greater
                opportunities for advancement in the future. Additionally,
                demonstrating leadership qualities such as initiative,
                accountability, and problem-solving can make you an asset to any
                team or organization. It can also help to create a positive work
                culture and improve team morale, leading to greater job
                satisfaction and overall productivity. Finally, practicing
                leadership skills in any position can help to prepare
                individuals for future leadership roles, as they will have
                already developed the necessary skills and mindset to lead
                effectively. Overall, acting like a leader, regardless of one's
                current position, is an important step towards personal growth
                and career advancement.

            <h5>Never stop learning</h5>
            <div class="pra">
              <p>
                Learning is an essential part of personal growth and
                development, and it plays a crucial role in both personal and
                professional success. It allows us to acquire new skills,
                knowledge, and perspectives, which helps us to adapt to changes
                and challenges in our lives. Continuous learning also helps to
                improve our problem-solving abilities, critical thinking skills,
                and creativity, enabling us to approach situations with a fresh
                and innovative mindset. Moreover, it can enhance our
                self-confidence, broaden our horizons, and provide us with a
                sense of fulfillment and purpose. In today's rapidly changing
                world, keeping up with new developments and acquiring new
                knowledge and skills is more important than ever before.
                Therefore, the benefits of learning are significant, and it is
                essential to make learning a lifelong habit.

                Speed is often a critical factor in determining success in
                today's fast-paced and competitive world. In many cases, being
                able to move quickly and efficiently can make the difference
                between achieving a goal or falling behind the competition.
                Speed can give an organization a competitive advantage, as it

                customers tend to appreciate fast and efficient service.
                Furthermore, speed can lead to greater efficiency, as it allows
                organizations to complete tasks and projects more quickly,
                freeing up time and resources to focus on other areas. Finally,
                speed can create a sense of urgency and momentum within an
                organization, driving innovation and progress. In summary, speed
                can be a crucial factor in achieving success in today's
                fast-paced world, and those who can move quickly and efficiently
                are often the ones who come out on top.
